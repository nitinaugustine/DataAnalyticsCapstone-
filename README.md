The Online Retail Dataset, used for the exploratory data analysis in this project, is a valuable resource for gaining insights into the operations of a UK-based online retail business specialising in unique all-occasion gifts. The dataset contains transactional data covering a period from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011, offering a comprehensive view of customer behaviour, purchase history, and product preferences. It provides an excellent opportunity to apply data analysis techniques to better understand the gifting industry and derive actionable insights that can benefit the business and its stakeholders.
In this report, we will delve into the findings and implications of the exploratory data analysis conducted on the Online Retail Dataset, shedding light on customer behaviour, product performance, and potential strategies for the company's growth and success in the dynamic gifting industry.
